# VSCode Keyboard Shortcuts

If you use VSCode as your text editor, then have you ever wondered what keyboard shortcuts might exist? Perhaps you have consulted VSCode's own documentation for keyboard shortcuts for both [MacOs](https://github.com/daniel-farlow/VSCode-Keyboard-Shortcuts/blob/master/VSCode%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts%20(MacOS).pdf) and [Windows](https://github.com/daniel-farlow/VSCode-Keyboard-Shortcuts/blob/master/VSCode%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts%20(Windows).pdf) (as PDF files).  

If you are like me, then you have probably found yourself asking how you can practically make use of these guides when there are *so* many possible shortcuts to learn, some of which seem highly relevant and others not so much.  

To make life simpler, I have created two markdown files, one for [MacOS](https://github.com/daniel-farlow/VSCode-Keyboard-Shortcuts/blob/master/vscode-keyboard-shortcuts-macos.md) and one for [Windows](https://github.com/daniel-farlow/VSCode-Keyboard-Shortcuts/blob/master/vscode-keyboard-shortcuts-windows.md), which essentially convert the PDFs linked to above into a "memory testing game" of sorts. 

For example, suppose you need to remember how to quickly copy a line(s) down or up. Then the following is how you would test yourself:

> **In MacOS:**
> <details><summary>Copy line down/up</summary>⇧⌥↓ / ⇧⌥↑</details>
> 
> If you know the correct keystrokes to accomplish the above effect in MacOS, then good for you! If not, click the triangle to reveal the desired keystrokes: ⇧⌥↓ / ⇧⌥↑

Similarly, we have the following for Windows:

> **In Windows:**
> <details><summary>Copy line down/up</summary>Shift+Alt + ↓ / ↑</details>
> 
> Desired keystrokes (click the dropdown triangle to test or refresh your memory): Shift+Alt + ↓ / ↑
